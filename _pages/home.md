### Hi!

I am a PhD student at Ca' Foscari University of Venice, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.dais.unive.it/~ferrara/">Prof. Pietro Ferrara</a>.
I am a member of the <a href="https://unive-ssv.github.io/">Software and System Verification (SSV)</a> research group, a team led by <a href="http://www.unive.it/persone/cortesi">Prof. Agostino Cortesi</a>.
